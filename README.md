# Wordle
## About the game:
Wordle is a word puzzle game where users have six chances to guess a five-letter word of the day.

### How to play:

When you start the game you have to guess a word that is 5 letters long which is generated when the game starts, and you have 6 attempts to guess the word. To make the game easy, I have reduced the time to wait for a word to change to 1 minute.

In each attempt and after you hit submit, you'll get a feedback about the correctness of the letter position using the GREEN, YELLOW, and GRAY colors.

### How to run the application:

1- clone the project

2- run **npm install**

3- run **npm start**

4- Go to localhost:3000
